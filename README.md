# Kasugai-Discord-Bot

A discord bot aimed to help students achieve higher academic responsibility.

This application was developed through the course of spring semester 2022
by a group of students for an Introduction to Software Development course.

The project went through 3 iterations,
with each iteration focused on different adaptive methods under Agile, including:
Scrum, 
XP (extreme programming), 
UP (unified practice)
